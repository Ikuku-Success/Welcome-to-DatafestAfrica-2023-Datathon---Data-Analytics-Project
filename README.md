## About
`This project is about AgResources Inc. It  is poised for expansion and strategic investment in its farms. They have collected vast amount of data over the years and it serves as a treasure trove to carve out the company's future direction. We are to extract in-depth insights and recommendations that will shape the company's strategic plans for the coming years.`

## Outcome
`After our analysis, we were able to do a crop profitability analysis, where we analyzed how changes in soil, pests, or weather conditions project into future profitability. We were also able to optimize water resource allocation by diving deep into our irrigation methods and sources. We also considered regional profitability potential, here we analyzed the regions and their respective performances and were able to check if there were underperforming regions where a shift in strategy or resources could unlock untapped potential. Alongside we did a comprehensive risk analysis by trying to craft a comprehensive risk profile for our farming operations to identify potential threats to our yield, profitability, or resources over the next decade. Finally, we made some strategic recommendations and roadmap to chart out a strategic roadmap for AgResources Inc. for the future as well as to identify investments, shifts in strategy, or innovations it might need to pursue for sustained growth and profitability`
